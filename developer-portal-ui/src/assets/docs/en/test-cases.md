# Test cases

After loading test data into the system, TPP developer can test XS2ABank endpoints with Swagger or Postman tests.

In [Swagger section](LINK TO SWAGGER SECTION) you can find information about usage of Swagger, prepared test data (_Jsons_) for testing and short API documentation. In [Postman tests section](LINK TO POSTMAN SECTION) you can find information about usage of Postman for testing and download prepared Postman tests with testing data.
