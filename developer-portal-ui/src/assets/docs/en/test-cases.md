# Test cases

After loading test data into the system, TPP developer can test XS2ABank endpoints with Swagger or Postman tests.

In [Swagger section](LINK TO SWAGGER SECTION) you can find information about usage of Swagger, prepared test data (_Jsons_) for testing and short API documentation. In [Postman tests section](LINK TO POSTMAN SECTION) you can find information about usage of Postman for testing and download prepared Postman tests with testing data.

Both sections provide tests for REDIRECT Strong Customer Authorisation (SCA) approach and EMBEDDED SCA Approach for Payment Initiation Service (PIS), Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Instrument Issuer Service (PIIS).
